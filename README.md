### Technology
This project is built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js(v16.13.0)) and uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

### Note
The application uses JWT for authentication in an unsecured way for demonstration purposes only. The tokens are stored in a way that is not secure and should not be used in a production environment. This project is intended to be a simple practice application.
